### Paper
We have chosen to reproduce the following research paper: __Latent Aspect Rating Analysis without Aspect Keyword Supervision__ by Hongning Wang, Yue Lu, ChengXiang Zhai ([DOI=10.1145/2020408.2020505](http://www.library.illinois.edu/proxy/go.php?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020505)). Our objectives include identifying:
- latent topical aspects
- ratings on each aspect
- weights on each aspect

### Programming Language
Python will be the programming language used for this project.

### Datasets
We will use one or more of the [datasets used in the original research paper](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/). Datasets include:
